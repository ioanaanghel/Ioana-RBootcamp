  bankAccounts <- interestRate*bankAccounts + bankAccounts
    #step 1 modify bankAccounts so that amounts reflect income and expenses
    #step 2 get calculate interest and add to accounts from step 1
    #you can actually use the line you have already written if you
    #modify amounts in bankAccounts directly in step 1

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
