## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## 1. 
```{r}
library(phytools)
setwd("~/GitHub/200A/")

snake.tree<-read.tree("homalops.phy")

h<-max(nodeHeights(snake.tree))
x<-seq(0,h,by=h/100)
b<-(log(Ntip(snake.tree))-log(2))/h

trees<-pbtree(b=b,n=Ntip(snake.tree),t=h,nsim=100,method="direct",
              quiet=TRUE)
g<-sapply(trees,function(x) ltt(x,plot=FALSE)$gamma)
hist(g,main=expression(paste("Distribution of ",gamma," from simulation")))

```

```{r}
mean(g)
var(g)
#We can test hypotheses about ??. This is done automatically with ltt. For example

obj<-ltt(snake.tree,plot=FALSE)
print(obj)
```

```{r}
plotTree(snake.tree,ftype="off")
```
#2. Given this gamma value, what would you conclude about the tempo of speciation in this clade?

This gamma value is negative and indicates that speciation events are closer to the roots of the tree than expected if the speciation rate is constant through time. Perhaps early history diversifcation was rapid and subsequently slowed down.

#3. 

```{r}
library(geiger)
age <- 22
richness <- 34
snakebirth <-  (log(richness) - log(2))/age
snakebirth

```


```{r}
richness <- 34
missing <- 13
#this simulates gamma values when trees are undersampled.
#we will grow trees with n=34 and prune them down to 21 taxa

snake.gamma <- obj$gamma

num_simulations<-200 #number of simulations
g1_null<-numeric(num_simulations) #g1_null will hold the simulated gamma values
for(i in 1:num_simulations) {
  sim.bdtree(snakebirth, d=0, stop = "taxa", n=richness)->sim_tree 
  drop.random(sim_tree, missing)->prune # prune down to the # of taxa in the phylogeny
    gammaStat(prune)->g1_null[i]
}
# create a histogram of the null distribution
hist(g1_null)

#arrow indicates where the observed gamma falls in the null you just generated
arrows(snake.gamma, 40, snake.gamma, 0, col="red", lwd=2) 
```

```{r}
# Which of the null values are smaller (more negative) than the data?
smallerNull<-g1_null<=snake.gamma
# How many TRUEs are there?
count<-sum(smallerNull)

# finally, what is the p-value?
mccr_pval<-(count+1)/(num_simulations+1)
mccr_pval
```

For MCCR test to suggest rapid initial diversification, we need P < 0.001. The p-value was higher, therefore we conclude that apparent rapid initial diversification may have been due to incomplete sampling. The gamma value does not fall in the tails of the distribution, so the tree could have been produced by a tree evolving under a constant rate that was incompletey sampled.

#4 
```{r}
library(phytools)
fitbd <- birthdeath(snake.tree)
fitbd
```

```{r}
bd(fitbd)
```

#5

```{r}
plant.tree<-read.nexus("T70460.nex")

obj<-ltt(plant.tree,plot=FALSE)
print(obj)

```
#5.(1) 
# The study used 53 species from Salvia subgenus Calosphace and 17 outgroups. There are 87 tips in this phylogeny (Benitez-Vieyra et al., 2014 - http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1782/20132934#ref-24) The Calosphace subgenus has a total of 468 species. (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00606-017-1445-4.pdf)


```{r}
plotTree(plant.tree,ftype="off")

```

#5.(2)
```{r}
library(phytools)
fitbd <- birthdeath(plant.tree)
fitbd

```

```{r}
bd(fitbd)
```

#5.(3)
```{r}
library(geiger)
age <- 12
richness <- 468
plantbirth <-  (log(richness) - log(2))/age
plantbirth
```

```{r}
richness <- 468
missing <- 398

plant.gamma <- obj$gamma

num_simulations<-200 #number of simulations
g1_null<-numeric(num_simulations) #g1_null will hold the simulated gamma values
for(i in 1:num_simulations) {
  sim.bdtree(plantbirth, d=0, stop = "taxa", n=richness)->sim_tree 
  drop.random(sim_tree, missing)->prune # prune down to the # of taxa in the phylogeny
    gammaStat(prune)->g1_null[i]
}
# create a histogram of the null distribution
hist(g1_null)

#arrow indicates where the observed gamma falls in the null you just generated
arrows(plant.gamma, 40, plant.gamma, 0, col="red", lwd=2)

```



```{r}
smallerNull<-g1_null<=plant.gamma
# How many TRUEs are there?
count<-sum(smallerNull)

# finally, what is the p-value?
mccr_pval<-(count+1)/(num_simulations+1)
mccr_pval
```
p-value is extremely high. Though the gamma is in the range of possibilities, gamma is not significant when taking into account the incomplete sampling. This was to be expected because the study had such few species.
